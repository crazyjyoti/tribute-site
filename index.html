                KK attended Delhi's Mount St Mary's School, and Kirori Mal College,Delhi University. He made an appearance in the song "Josh of India", released to support the Indian Cricket Team during the 1999 Cricket World Cup.
                
                KK married Jyothy in 1991. His son Nakul Krishna Kunnath sang the song "Masti" from his album Humsafar with him.KK also had a daughter.</p>

                <p>After graduating in commerce from Kirori Mal College, KK did a six-month stint as a marketing executive before pursuing his passion for music.

                <p>KK did not have any formal training in music.[16] According to film director Mahesh Bhatt, "KK had an emotional bandwidth which echoed all the seasons of the heart. He could be frivolous, romantic and anguished. He could go into the depths, talk about the wonder and magic of life."[17]

                    KK emphasized that it is not important for a singer's face to be prominently seen; he believed the important thing was that "a singer must be heard".[18] In a 2019 interview, KK said he felt comfortable with the microphone but awkward in front of a camera. He valued and "fiercely" protected his privacy.[19] In his playback songs, KK never wanted his singing to be associated with any particular actor and preferred singing for diverse actors.[20]</p><br><br>
